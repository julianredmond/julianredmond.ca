name: "Monster"
text: |
  This is a looping animation I created based on a t-shirt that I designed and screen-printed. The shirt showed a monster with its claws tearing out from inside the shirt. I began with a storyboard to get an idea of how the animation would look and how I would create it. I got some photography done of myself wearing the shirt to use for the animation. I then began drawing the animation in frames over top of the photograph. All of the frames were joined together and the final piece was created.
