  The goal of this project was to design the branding and packaging for a series of food products that I invented. I selected fresh berries as the products I would design for and named the brand “BoldBerry”.
  <br><br>
  BoldBerry sells fresh berries of all sorts and their target audience is hip young adults who are interested in a healthy natural diet and lifestyle.

  The process began with brainstorming the look and feel of the BoldBerry brand through the creation of moodboards.
text-3: |
  The next step was to sketch all sorts of concepts for the design of the BoldBerry logo.
text-4: |
  After many rounds of concept sketching, the final brand identity was created. The design is simple, bold, and stylish in order to appeal to the target audience.
text-5: |
  Custom lettering was drawn for the product packaging of each variety of berries. This helps the brand stand out in a more personal and unique way.

  The packaging dieline used for BoldBerry products is a pint-sized ice cream style container made with a raw paper material. This packaging style completely eliminates plastic other than a thin seal under the lid. The raw paper style reflects the organic healthy nature of the products and allows the graphics to shine.
  <br><br>
  The designs are colourful, illustrative, fun, and they are designed to contrast with the logo.

  These are the lids for the packaging.
