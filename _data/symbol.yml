name: "Sweeney Todd"

  This is a symbol that I designed to represent the character, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. I did a lot of research on the character to begin this project and then began sketching out lots of ideas.

  I chose to use Sweeney Todd’s straight razor and Misses Lovett’s rolling pin as the main aspects of the design. I represented them in a very simple way and crossed one over the other to accentuate the symbolic look. I used a pie crust design and blood splatters as secondary elements to create a border around the main aspects which highlight them well.

  For the colour version of this symbol, I chose to use black as the main colour as it reflects the dark nature of this story very well. As a secondary colour choice, I chose red to represent the abundant violence and blood that is involved in this story. I used the colour red in the blood splatter portion of this design so this colour choice is very fitting.
