  This is a logo redesign for Ottawa craft brewery, Vimy Brewing Company. They are a small Ottawa brewery founded by 2 brothers who are former reservists in the Royal Canadian Navy. The company represents Canada and Canadian achievements by brewing small batches of beer using high quality ingredients.

  I began with a lot of research on Vimy Brewing Company in order to figure out some directions to take with the logo design. I focused on 2 possible directions and did many rounds of sketching until I had 2 solid and unique concepts. The concepts were vectorized to present to the client and one was chosen to be improved and finalized.
  <br><br>
  The final logo uses a single colour and black or it can be presented just in black. I completed a logo standards guide for the client in addition to the logo design.
